groebner_basis(polynomials; ordering=:deglex)

Computes a Groebner basis of the ideal generated by the given `polynomials`. 
The basis is reduced, thus guaranteed to be unique.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> using Symbolics

julia> @variables x y;

julia> groebner_basis([x*y^2 + x, x^2*y + y])
```

The coefficients in the resulting basis are in the same domain as for input polynomials.
Hence, if the coefficient becomes too large to be represented exactly, `DomainError` is throwed. 

By default, degree lexicographic monomial ordering is used. 
All possible orderings are:

- `lex` for lexicographic;
- `deglex` for degree lexicographic;
- `degrevlex` for degree reversed lexicographic.

The basis will be correct with respect to the specified ordering, 
however, the terms in the output will always be ordered with `deglex`.
