Its goal is very different from Sympy: it was made to support symbolic-numerics, the combination of symbolic computing with numerical methods to allow for extreme performance computing that would not be possible without modifying the model. Because of this, Symbolics.jl excels in many areas due to purposeful design decisions:","category":"page"},{"location":"comparison/","page":"Comparison Against SymPy","title":"Comparison Against SymPy","text":"Performance: Symbolics.jl is built in Julia, whereas SymPy was built in Python. Thus, the performance bar for Symbolics.jl is much higher. Symbolics.jl started because SymPy was far too slow and SymEngine was far too inflexible for the projects they were doing. Performance is key to Symbolics.jl. If you find any performance issues, please file an issue.\nbuild_function: lambdify is “fine” for some people, but if you're building a super fast MPI-enabled Julia/C/Fortran simulation code, having a function that hits the Python interpreter is less than optimal. By default, build_function builds fast JIT-compiled functions due to being in Julia. However, it has support for things like static arrays, non-allocating functions via mutation, fast functions on sparse matrices and arrays of arrays, etc.: all core details of doing high performance computing.\nParallelism: Symbolics.jl has pervasive parallelism. The symbolic simplification via SymbolicUtils.jl has built-in parallelism, Symbolics.jl builds functions that parallelize across threads. Symbolics.jl is compatible with GPU libraries like CUDA.jl.\nExtensible: Symbolics.jl and its underlying tools are written in pure Julia. Want to add new or better simplification rules? Add some Julia code! Need to add new derivatives? Add some Julia code! You get the picture. Breaking down these barriers makes it easier for the user to tailor the program to their needs and accelerates the development of the library.\nDeep integration with the Julia ecosystem: Symbolics.jl's integration with neural networks is not the only thing that's deep. Symbolics.jl is built with the same philosophy as other SciML packages, eschewing “monorepos” for a distributed development approach that ties together the work of many developers. The differentiation parts utilize tools from automatic differentiation libraries, all linear algebra functionality comes from tracing Julia Base itself, symbolic rewriting (simplification and substitution) comes from SymbolicUtils.jl, parallelism comes from Julia Base libraries, Dagger.jl, etc. SciML Tools like DataDrivenDiffEq.jl can reconstruct symbolic expressions from neural networks and data, while NeuralPDE.jl can automatically solve partial differential equations from symbolic descriptions using physics-informed neural networks. The list keeps going. All told, by design Symbolics.jl's development moves fast because it's effectively using the work of hundreds of Julia developers, allowing it to grow fast.\nWhile Symbolics.jl has many features missing from SymPy, it does not superset SymPy's functionality. For a list of missing features, see this issue.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/groebner/#Groebner-bases","page":"Groebner bases","title":"Groebner bases","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/groebner/","page":"Groebner bases","title":"Groebner bases","text":"Groebner bases use the implementation of the F4 algorithm from  Groebner.jl package as its backend.

This is the trivial expression tree of a single variable without a wrapper, and is not a subtype of String or AbstractString.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/types/","page":"Supported types and dispatch in Symbolics","title":"Supported types and dispatch in Symbolics","text":"using Symbolics\n@variables x::Real z::Complex{Real} (X::Real)[1:10, 1:10] (Z::Complex{Real})[1:10] s::String","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/types/","page":"Supported types and dispatch in Symbolics","title":"Supported types and dispatch in Symbolics","text":"typeof(x)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/types/","page":"Supported types and dispatch in Symbolics","title":"Supported types and dispatch in Symbolics","text":"typeof(z)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/types/","page":"Supported types and dispatch in Symbolics","title":"Supported types and dispatch in Symbolics","text":"typeof(X)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/types/","page":"Supported types and dispatch in Symbolics","title":"Supported types and dispatch in Symbolics","text":"typeof(Z)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/types/","page":"Supported types and dispatch in Symbolics","title":"Supported types and dispatch in Symbolics","text":"typeof(s)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/parsing/#Parsing-Julia-Expressions-to-Symbolic-Expressions","page":"Parsing Julia Expressions to Symbolic Expressions","title":"Parsing Julia Expressions to Symbolic Expressions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/parsing/","page":"Parsing Julia Expressions to Symbolic Expressions","title":"Parsing Julia Expressions to Symbolic Expressions","text":"Julia expressions such as :(y - x) are fundamentally different from symbolic expressions, as they do not have an algebra defined on them.

The way this functionality handles this problem is that it does not define anything as symbolic that is already defined in the chosen mod module. For example, f(x,y) will have f as non-symbolic if the function f (named f) is defined in mod, i.e. if isdefined(mod,:f) is true. When the symbol is defined, it will be replaced by its value. Notably, this means that the parsing behavior changes depending on the environment that it is applied.\n\nFor example:\n\nparse_expr_to_symbolic(:(x - y),@__MODULE__) # x - y\nx = 2.0\nparse_expr_to_symbolic(:(x - y),@__MODULE__) # 2.0 - y\n\nThis is required to detect that standard functions like - are functions instead of symbolic symbols. For safety, one should create anonymous modules or other sub-environments to ensure no stray variables are defined.\n\nMetadata is Blank\n\nBecause all the variables defined by the expressions are not defined with the standard @variables, there is no metadata that is or can be associated with any of the generated variables. Instead, they all have blank metadata, but are defined in the Real domain. Thus, the variables which come out of this parsing may not evaluate as equal to a symbolic variable defined elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"manual/variables/#Variable-and-Equation-Types","page":"Variable and Equation Types","title":"Variable and Equation Types","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/variables/","page":"Variable and Equation Types","title":"Variable and Equation Types","text":"Symbolics IR mirrors the Julia AST but allows for easy mathematical manipulation by itself following mathematical semantics.

By smart here we mean that polynomials are counted as 1 occurrence. for example x^2 + 2x is 1 occurrence of x. So we abstract all occurrences of x's as polynomials. Say: log(x+1) + x^2 is seen as log(f(x)) + g(x) so there are 2 occurrences of x. If there is only 1 occurrence of x in an input expression, isolate is called.\n\nIsolate reverses all operations applied on the occurrence of x until we have f(x) = some constant then we can solve this using our polynomial solvers.\n\nIf more than 1 occurrence of x is found, ia_solve attempts to attract the occurrences of x in order to reduce these occurrences to 1. For example, log(x+1) + log(x-1) can be converted to log(x^2 - 1) which now could be isolated using Isolate.\n\nattract(lhs, var) currently uses 4 techniques for attraction.\n\nLog addition: log(f(x)) + log(g(x)) => log(h(x))\nExponential simplification: a*b^(f(x)) + c*d^(g(x)) => f(x) * log(b) - g(x) * log(d) + log(-a/c). And now this is actually 1 occurrence of x since f(x) and g(x) are just multiplied by constants not wrapped in some operation.\nTrig simplification: this bruteforces multiple trig identities and doesn't detect them before hand.\nPolynomialization: as a last resort, attract attempts to polynomialize the expression. Say sin(x+2)^2 + sin(x+2) + 10 is converted to X^2 + X + 10, we then solve this using our polynomial solver, and afterwards, isolate sin(x+2) = the roots found by solve for X^2 + X + 10\n\nAfter attraction, we check the number of occurrences again, and if its 1, we isolate, if not, we throw an error to tell the user that this is currently unsolvable by our covered techniques.\n\nArguments\n\nlhs: a Num/SymbolicUtils.BasicSymbolic\nvar: variable to solve for.\n\nKeyword arguments\n\nwarns = true: Whether to emit warnings for unsolvable expressions.\ncomplex_roots = true: Whether to consider complex roots of x ^ n ~ y, where n is an integer.\nperiodic_roots = true: If true, isolate f(x) ~ y as x ~ finv(y) + n * period where  is_periodic(f) == true, finv = left_inverse(f) and period = fundamental_period(f). n  is a new anonymous symbolic variable.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> solve(a*x^b + c, x)\n((-c)^(1 / b)) / (a^(1 / b))\n\njulia> solve(2^(x+1) + 5^(x+3), x)\n1-element Vector{SymbolicUtils.BasicSymbolic{Real}}:\n (-log(2) + 3log(5) - log(complex(-1))) / (log(2) - log(5))\n\njulia> solve(log(x+1)+log(x-1), x)\n2-element Vector{SymbolicUtils.BasicSymbolic{Real}}:\n (1//2)*RootFinding.ssqrt(8.0)\n (-1//2)*RootFinding.ssqrt(8.0)\n\njulia> expr = sin(x+2)^2 + sin(x+2) + 10\n10 + sin(2 + x) + sin(2 + x)^2\n\njulia> RootFinding.ia_solve(expr, x)\n[ Info: var\"##230\" ϵ Ζ: e.g. 0, 1, 2...\n[ Info: var\"##234\" ϵ Ζ: e.g. 0, 1, 2...\n2-element Vector{SymbolicUtils.BasicSymbolic{Real}}:\n -2 + π*2var\"##230\" + asin((1//2)*(-1 + RootFinding.ssqrt(-39)))\n -2 + π*2var\"##234\" + asin((1//2)*(-1 - RootFinding.ssqrt(-39)))\n\nAll transcendental functions for which left_inverse is defined are supported.
