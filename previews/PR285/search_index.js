Its goal is very different from Sympy: it was made to support symbolic-numerics, the combination of symbolic computing with numerical methods to allow for extreme performance computing that would not be possible without modifying the model. Because of this, Symbolics.jl excels in many areas due to purposeful design decisions:","category":"page"},{"location":"comparison/#","page":"Comparison Against SymPy","title":"Comparison Against SymPy","text":"Performance: Symbolics.jl is built in Julia, whereas SymPy was built in Python. Thus the performance bar for Symbolics.jl is much higher. Symbolics.jl started because SymPy was far too slow and SymEngine was far too inflexible for the projects they were doing. Performance is key to Symbolics.jl. If you find any performance issues, please file an issue.\nbuild_function: lambdify is \"fine\" for some people, but if you're building a super fast MPI-enabled Julia/C/Fortran simulation code, having a function that hits the Python interpreter is less than optimal. By default, build_function builds fast JIT-compiled functions due to being in Julia. However, it has support for things like static arrays, non-allocating functions via mutation, fast functions on sparse matrices and arrays of arrays, etc.: all core details of doing high performance computing.\nParallelism: Symbolics.jl has pervasive parallelism. The symbolic simplification via SymbolicUtils.jl has built-in parallelism, Symbolics.jl builds functions that parallelizes across threads. Symbolics.jl is compatible with GPU libraries like CUDA.jl.\nExtendability: All of Symbolics.jl and its underlying tools are written in pure Julia. Want to add new or better simplification rules? Add some Julia code! Need to add new derivatives? Add some Julia code! You get the picture. Breaking down these barriers makes it easier for the user to tailor the program to their needs and accelerates the development of the library.\nDeep integration with the Julia ecosystem: Symbolics.jl's integration with neural networks is not the only thing that's deep. Symbolics.jl is built with the same philosophy as other SciML packages, eschewing \"monorepos\" for a distributed development approach that ties together the work of many developers. The differentiation parts utilize tools from automatic differentiation libraries, all linear algebra functionality comes from tracing Julia Base itself, symbolic rewriting (simplification and substitution) comes from SymbolicUtils.jl, parallelism comes from Julia Base libraries and Dagger.jl, and etc. SciML Tools like DataDrivenDiffEq.jl can reconstruct symbolic expressions from neural networks and data while NeuralPDE.jl can automatically solve partial differential equations from symbolic descriptions using physics-informed neural networks. The list keeps going. All told, by design Symbolics.jl's development moves fast because it's effectively using the work of hundreds of Julia developers, allowing it to grow fast.\nWhile Symbolics.jl has many features missing from SymPy, it does not superset SymPy's functionality. For a list of missing features, see this issue.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/variables/#Variable-and-Equation-Types-1","page":"Variable and Equation Types","title":"Variable and Equation Types","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/variables/#","page":"Variable and Equation Types","title":"Variable and Equation Types","text":"Symbolics IR mirrors the Julia AST but allows for easy mathematical manipulation by itself following mathematical semantics.

It's using A.nzval in order to linearly index through the sparse matrix, avoiding the A[i,j] form because that is a more expensive way to index a sparse matrix if you know exactly the order that the data is stored. Then, it's splitting up the calculation into Julia threads so they can be operated on in parallel. It synchronizes after spawning all of the tasks so the computation is ensured to be complete before moving on.
