# [Solving Symbolic Equations](@id symbolic_solver)

The main symbolic solver for Symbolics.jl is `symbolic_solve`. Symbolic solving
means that it only uses symbolic (algebraic) methods and outputs exact solutions.

```@docs
Symbolics.symbolic_solve
```

One other symbolic solver is `symbolic_linear_solve` which is limited compared to 
`symbolic_solve` as it only solves linear equations.

```@docs
Symbolics.symbolic_linear_solve
```

`symbolic_solve` only supports symbolic, i.e. non-floating point computations, and thus prefers equations
where the coefficients are integer, rational, or symbolic. Floating point coefficients are transformed into
rational values and BigInt values are used internally with a potential performance loss, and thus it is recommended
that this functionality is only used with floating point values if necessary. In contrast, `symbolic_linear_solve`
directly handles floating point values using standard factorizations.

### More technical details and examples

#### Technical details

The `symbolic_solve` function uses 4 hidden solvers in order to solve the user's input. Its base,
`solve_univar`, uses analytic solutions up to polynomials of degree 4 and factoring as its method
for solving univariate polynomials. The function's `solve_multipoly` uses GCD on the input polynomials then throws passes the result
to `solve_univar`. The function's `solve_multivar` uses Groebner basis and a separating form in order to create linear equations in the
input variables and a single high degree equation in the separating variable [^1]. Each equation resulting from the basis is then passed
to `solve_univar`. We can see that essentially, `solve_univar` is the building block of `symbolic_solve`. If the input is not a valid polynomial and can not be solved by the algorithm above, `symbolic_solve` passes
it to `ia_solve`, which attempts solving by attraction and isolation [^2]. This only works when the input is a single expression
and the user wants the answer in terms of a single variable. Say `log(x) - a == 0` gives us `[e^a]`.

#### Nice examples

```@example solver
using Symbolics, Nemo;
@variables x;
Symbolics.symbolic_solve(9^x + 3^x ~ 8, x)
```

```@example solver
@variables x y z;
Symbolics.symbolic_linear_solve(2//1*x + y - 2//1*z ~ 9//1*x, 1//1*x)
```

```@example solver
using Groebner;
@variables x y z;

eqs = [x^2 + y + z - 1, x + y^2 + z - 1, x + y + z^2 - 1]
Symbolics.symbolic_solve(eqs, [x,y,z])
```

### SymPy Integration

SymPy also includes solves as well, and the SymPy.jl extensions allow for automatically converting
Symbolics expressions for use in its solvers.
